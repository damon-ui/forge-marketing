    <div class="container">
      <h2>You're a travel advisor, not a data entry clerk.</h2>
      <p>You got into this business to create amazing experiences&#8212;not to spend your evenings copying confirmation numbers into spreadsheets, reformatting PDFs, and stitching together Google Docs that you're not quite proud to send.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the "professional" tools cost $40/month and were built for full-time agencies with dedicated ops teams. Not for you, working nights and weekends to build something real.</p>
      <p class="highlight">There's a better way.</p>

      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Who is FORGE for?</summary>
          <p>Travel advisors who want professional tools without enterprise pricing. Whether you're part-time, just starting out, or a seasoned pro who's tired of overpaying&#8212;FORGE is built for you.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How does the AI ingestion work?</summary>
          <p>Paste or upload a screenshot, PDF, or booking confirmation. FORGE uses AI to extract the key details (dates, prices, cabin types, hotel info, etc.) and builds a structured trip you can edit and refine.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What's a "comparison"?</summary>
          <p>When you're ready to share options with a client, you create a comparison. Clients see a side-by-side view and can vote on their favorite. It's how you go from "here are some options" to "let's book this one."</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I try it before paying?</summary>
          <p>Yes. We'll offer a free trial at launch so you can see how it fits your workflow.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What makes FORGE different from other tools?</summary>
          <p>Most tools were built for large agencies with full-time staff. FORGE is built for real advisors&#8212;people who work nights and weekends building something meaningful. We combine AI-powered speed, beautiful client-facing tools, and pricing that respects your budget.</p>
