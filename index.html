      <p>Meanwhile, the "professional" tools cost $40/month and were built for full-time agencies with dedicated ops teams. Not for you, working nights and weekends to build something real.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Who is FORGE for?</summary>
          <p>Travel advisors who want professional tools without enterprise pricing. Whether you're part-time, just starting out, or a seasoned pro&#8212;FORGE was built specifically for advisors who don't have hours to spend on data entry. We built it because we needed it ourselves.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How does the AI ingestion work?</summary>
          <p>Paste or upload a screenshot, PDF, or booking confirmation. FORGE uses AI to extract the key details (dates, prices, cabin types, hotel info, etc.) and builds a structured trip you can edit and refine. Or just chat with FORGE&#8212;describe the trip in your own words and let AI build it for you.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What's a "comparison"?</summary>
          <p>When you're ready to share options with a client, you create a comparison. Clients see a side-by-side view and can vote on their favorite. It's how you go from "here are some options" to "let's book this one."</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I try it before paying?</summary>
          <p>Yes. We'll offer a free trial at launch so you can see how it fits your workflow.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What makes FORGE different from other tools?</summary>
          <p>Three things: First, AI-first data entry&#8212;while other tools have you dragging and dropping or typing manually, FORGE extracts details from screenshots and PDFs automatically. Second, client voting&#8212;your clients can vote on their favorite options right from the comparison, so you know exactly what resonates. Third, price&#8212;at $15/month, we're built for advisors who book 5-50 trips a year, not agencies with dedicated ops teams.</p>
