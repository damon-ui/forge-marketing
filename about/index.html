        <p class="about-intro">I'm Damon, and I built FORGE because I needed it myself.</p>
        
        <p>Like many travel advisors, I started part-time&#8212;nights, weekends, stolen moments between my day job. I loved helping friends and family plan trips, and I wanted to turn that passion into something real.</p>
        
        <p>But the tools? They weren't built for people like me.</p>
        
        <p>The professional platforms cost $40 or more per month and were designed for agencies with full-time staff and dedicated operations teams. The free alternatives meant cobbling together Google Docs, spreadsheets, and email threads&#8212;functional, but not the kind of experience I wanted to give my clients.</p>
        
        <p>I kept thinking: why isn't there something in between? Something polished and professional, but priced for advisors who are still building their business?</p>
        
        <p>So I built it.</p>
        
        <h2>What FORGE is really about</h2>
        
        <p>FORGE isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It's focused on the moments that matter most in the advisor-client relationship:</p>
        
        <ul class="about-list">
          <li><strong>Getting trip details out of your inbox and into a usable format</strong>&#8212;fast, with AI doing the heavy lifting</li>
          <li><strong>Presenting options in a way that helps clients decide</strong>&#8212;clean side-by-side comparisons they can vote on</li>
          <li><strong>Giving clients something they'll actually use</strong>&#8212;a beautiful, mobile-ready itinerary with every detail at their fingertips</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>That's it. No bloated feature lists. No enterprise complexity. Just the tools you need to look professional and save time.</p>
        
        <h2>Why the name?</h2>
        
        <p>A forge is where raw materials become something useful. That's what this tool does&#8212;takes the raw chaos of booking confirmations, screenshots, and PDFs and shapes them into polished, client-ready deliverables.</p>
        
        <p>Plus, it sounds pretty cool.</p>
        
        <h2>What's next</h2>
        
        <p>I'm building FORGE in public, talking to advisors, and adding features based on what we actually need&#8212;not what sounds good on a feature comparison chart.</p>
        
        <p>CRM and commission tracking are coming. Not because every tool has them, but because keeping track of clients and what you've earned shouldn't require yet another subscription.</p>
        
        <p>If you're a travel advisor who's been piecing things together with free tools and determination, I built this for you.</p>
