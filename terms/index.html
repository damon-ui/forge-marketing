        <h2 id="what-forge-does">1. What FORGE Does</h2>
        <p>FORGE is a platform designed for travel advisors. It helps you create professional trip comparisons for your clients using AI-powered tools that extract trip details from screenshots, PDFs, and other documents. Your clients can then review and vote on trip options you present to them.</p>
        <p>The Service includes features for travel advisors ("Advisors") who create accounts, as well as functionality for their clients ("Clients") who access trip comparisons via shared links without creating accounts.</p>
        
        <h2 id="who-can-use">2. Who Can Use FORGE</h2>
        <p>To use FORGE as an Advisor, you must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement. If you're using FORGE on behalf of a business or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>
        <p>Clients who access trip comparisons via shared links are also bound by these Terms. By viewing or interacting with a comparison page, Clients agree to the applicable portions of these Terms.</p>
        
        <h2 id="your-account">3. Your Account</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Account Creation</h3>
        <p>You create an account by providing your email address. We'll send you a secure link to access your account (magic link authentication) or you may set a password. You're responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all activity under your account.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Account Information</h3>
        <p>You agree to provide accurate information when creating your account and to keep it updated. We may use this information to contact you about your account or the Service.</p>
        
        <h3>3.3 One Account Per Person</h3>
        <p>Each person should have only one account. Don't share your login credentials with others.</p>
        
        <h2 id="your-data">4. Your Data and Content</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 You Own Your Data</h3>
        <p>You retain ownership of all trip data, client information, comparisons, and other content you create or upload to FORGE ("Your Content"). We don't claim any ownership rights in Your Content.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2 License to Us</h3>
        <p>By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to host, store, process, and display Your Content solely to provide the Service to you. This license ends when you delete Your Content or close your account.</p>
        
        <h3>4.3 Data Portability</h3>
        <p>You can export your data from FORGE at any time. We believe your data belongs to you, and we won't hold it hostage.</p>
        
        <h3>4.4 Backups</h3>
        <p>While we maintain backups of the Service, you're responsible for maintaining your own backups of important data. We recommend keeping copies of critical trip information in your own systems.</p>
        
        <h2 id="ai-features">5. AI Features</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 How AI Works in FORGE</h3>
        <p>FORGE uses artificial intelligence (specifically, Anthropic's Claude) to extract trip details from screenshots, PDFs, and other documents you provide. The AI attempts to identify relevant information like dates, prices, cabin types, and itinerary details.</p>
        
        <h3>5.2 AI Limitations</h3>
        <p>AI extraction is not perfect. You should always review and verify extracted information before presenting it to clients. We are not responsible for errors in AI-extracted data that you don't catch before sharing with clients.</p>
        
        <h3>5.3 Your Responsibility</h3>
        <p>FORGE is a tool to help you work more efficiently—it doesn't replace your professional judgment. You remain responsible for the accuracy of all trip information you present to clients, regardless of whether it was extracted by AI or entered manually.</p>
        
        <h2 id="subscriptions">6. Subscriptions and Payment</h2>
        
        <h3>6.1 Free Trial</h3>
        <p>New accounts receive a free trial period. During the trial, you have access to the Service's features. When your trial ends, you'll need to subscribe to continue using the Service.</p>
        
        <h3>6.2 Subscription Plans</h3>
        <p>We offer different subscription tiers with varying features and usage limits. Current plans and pricing are displayed on our website. We may change pricing with 30 days' notice.</p>
        
        <h3>6.3 Billing</h3>
        <p>Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually, depending on your choice. Payment is due at the start of each billing period. We use Stripe to process payments securely.</p>
        
        <h3>6.4 Cancellation</h3>
        <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. If you cancel, you'll retain access until the end of your current billing period. We don't offer refunds for partial months or years.</p>
        
        <h3>6.5 Changes to Your Plan</h3>
        <p>You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing period.</p>
        
        <h2 id="acceptable-use">7. Acceptable Use</h2>
        
        <h3>7.1 Don't Abuse the Service</h3>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or to promote illegal activities</li>
          <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or other users' accounts</li>
          <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service's operations</li>
          <li>Use automated tools to scrape or extract data from the Service (except through our official API, if offered)</li>
          <li>Share your account credentials with others or resell access to the Service</li>
          <li>Upload malicious content, viruses, or harmful code</li>
          <li>Create multiple accounts to abuse free trials or promotions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>7.2 Client Data</h3>
        <p>You're responsible for ensuring you have the right to store and process any client data you add to FORGE. Don't upload data about people without appropriate consent or legal basis.</p>
        
        <h2 id="client-features">8. Client-Facing Features</h2>
        
        <h3>8.1 Comparison Links</h3>
        <p>When you create a comparison and share it with clients, anyone with the link can view it. Be thoughtful about what information you include and who you share links with.</p>
        
        <h3>8.2 Client Voting</h3>
        <p>Clients can vote on options and leave feedback without creating accounts. This information is stored and shared with you (the Advisor). Clients should be aware that their votes and feedback will be visible to their travel advisor.</p>
        
        <h3>8.3 No Direct Client Relationship</h3>
        <p>FORGE provides tools for Advisors to serve their clients. We don't have a direct relationship with your clients. You're responsible for your client relationships and any disputes that arise with them.</p>
        
        <h2 id="intellectual-property">9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        
        <h3>9.1 Our Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>FORGE, including its design, features, code, and branding, is our intellectual property. These Terms don't grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or other brand elements.</p>
        
        <h3>9.2 Feedback</h3>
        <p>If you provide suggestions, feature requests, or other feedback about the Service, we may use it without obligation to you.</p>
        
        <h2 id="disclaimers">10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</strong> We don't warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. We don't warrant that AI features will extract information accurately or completely.</p>
        <p>You use the Service at your own risk. We're not responsible for any decisions you make based on information in the Service, including booking recommendations you make to clients.</p>
        
        <h2 id="liability">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WON'T BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</strong></p>
        <p>Our total liability for any claims arising from these Terms or the Service is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months before the claim arose, or $100, whichever is greater.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions don't allow certain warranty disclaimers or liability limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>
        
        <h2 id="indemnification">12. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your use of the Service</li>
          <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
          <li>Your violation of any third-party rights</li>
          <li>Any dispute between you and your clients</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="disputes">13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        
        <h3>13.1 Informal Resolution First</h3>
        <p>If you have a dispute with us, please contact us first at <a href="mailto:legal@forgetravel.co">legal@forgetravel.co</a>. We'll try to resolve it informally within 30 days.</p>
        
        <h3>13.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <p>If we can't resolve a dispute informally, you and we agree to resolve it through binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration will take place in South Carolina or remotely at your choice.</p>
        
        <h3>13.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>You agree to resolve disputes with us individually. You waive any right to bring or participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions.</p>
        
        <h3>13.4 Exceptions</h3>
        <p>Either party may bring claims in small claims court if eligible. Either party may seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property violations.</p>
        
        <h2 id="termination">14. Termination</h2>
        
        <h3>14.1 You Can Leave Anytime</h3>
        <p>You can close your account at any time by contacting us or using the account settings. We'll delete your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h3>14.2 We Can Terminate for Cause</h3>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, abuse the Service, or engage in conduct that harms us or other users. We'll try to give you notice before termination unless the violation is severe.</p>
        
        <h3>14.3 Effect of Termination</h3>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends. Sections of these Terms that should survive (like limitations of liability and dispute resolution) will continue to apply.</p>
        
        <h2 id="changes">15. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you by email or through the Service at least 30 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service after changes take effect means you accept the new Terms.</p>
        
        <h2 id="general">16. General Provisions</h2>
        
        <h3>16.1 Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of South Carolina, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
        
        <h3>16.2 Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.</p>
        
        <h3>16.3 Severability</h3>
        <p>If any part of these Terms is found unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.</p>
        
        <h3>16.4 No Waiver</h3>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms isn't a waiver of our right to do so later.</p>
        
        <h3>16.5 Assignment</h3>
        <p>You can't assign your rights under these Terms without our consent. We may assign our rights to any successor in interest.</p>
